<h2>My interests:</h2>

    When it comes to my interests, everything is all over the place.
    Seriously, my taste in games varies from RDR2 to BSS.

    Here's a list of some games I like:
    -Red Dead Redemption 2,
    -Spore,
    -Clash of Clans,
    -Outer Wilds (I haven't beaten the game, no spoilers please!!),
    -Bee Swarm Simulator,
    -Hollow Knight,
    -Valorant and Cs2 (Recently not as much.)

    Moving onto music, yet again, everything is all over the place.
